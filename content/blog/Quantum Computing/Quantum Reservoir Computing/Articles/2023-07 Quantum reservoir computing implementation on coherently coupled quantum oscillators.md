2023-07 Quantum reservoir computing implementation on coherently coupled quantum oscillators

[Dudas, J., Carles, B., Plouet, E. _et al._ Quantum reservoir computing implementation on coherently coupled quantum oscillators. _npj Quantum Inf_ **9**, 64 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41534-023-00734-4)

Interesting read about a highly effective experimental implementation of quantum reservoir computing (QRC), a promising approach for quantum neural networks that excels in tackling challenging learning tasks involving classical and quantum input data. In contrast to classical reservoirs, quantum reservoirs have the advantage of encoding neurons as basis states, allowing for an exponential increase in the number of neurons based on the number of physical devices. Instead of the conventional approach of using physically coupled qubits, the authors ingeniously employ parametrically coupled quantum oscillators and their associated states as the quantum reservoir. This strategic decision overcomes the limitations observed in current QRC implementations that rely on superconducting qubits with restricted connectivity.

The research showcases remarkable achievements in time series classification and regression tasks, all accomplished with fewer resources than traditional qubits. Moreover, quantum oscillators possess a clear edge in terms of scalability compared to qubits due to their infinite number of basis states, as opposed to the limited two states of qubits. Additionally, they can be more efficiently populated using resonant drives and coherent coupling.

In summary, in my opinion, this work represents a significant advancement in quantum computing and opens up new possibilities for more powerful and scalable quantum neural networks with broader applications.
